# 3D Model Viewer API

This is a Python-based API for rendering and viewing 3D models in a graphical window. The API is designed to be flexible and extensible, and can work with a variety of 3D file formats.

## Requirements

To use the 3D Model Viewer API, you will need:

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- A 3D file format parser library such as PyWavefront or PyMesh
- A graphics library such as PyOpenGL or Pygame

## Installation

To install the API, you can either clone this repository or download the ZIP file and extract it to your local machine. Once you have the files, you can install any necessary dependencies by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the API, you will need to write code to load 3D models and render them in a window. Here is an example code snippet that loads an OBJ file and renders it using PyOpenGL:
